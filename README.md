# Industry Project for Big W – One of the big retail stores in Australia
Objective: The primary aim was to analyze BIG W's sales data, a renowned discount department store
under the Woolworths Group, to uncover patterns and behaviors that can potentially drive the store's sales.
This involved understanding past sales trends, predicting future ones, and furnishing actionable
recommendations to BIG W.

Methods: Utilized various predictive models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting, Lasso, and ARIMA. The choice of modeling technique was determined by the nature of
the data and the specific business context.

Key Findings:

• Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis:

• Majority of BIG W sales are from physical store channels.

• Positive relationship observed between media spend and total sale value in each state.

• Proximity to competitors like Kmart and Target has a varied impact on sales.

• Seasonal peaks in sales observed during the Christmas season.

• Budget-Young Families category emerged as the highest contributor to sales.

Model Evaluation:

• The Gradient Boosting Model demonstrated the best performance among the traditional machine
learning models, with an R2 value of 0.619631 and RMSE of 0.867222.

• The ARIMA model, suited for time series data, had an RMSE of 0.284, indicating high accuracy.

Recommendations:

• Allocate the advertising budget more strategically to align with the specific consumption habits of
different regions.

• Explore the possibility of opening new stores in the VIC region, especially in locations near
competitors like Kmart and Target.

• Strengthen product and promotional strategies targeting the Budget-Young Families segment. For
the Premium-Older Families segment, delve deeper into their preferences and purchasing
behaviors.

Conclusion: By leveraging data-driven insights and adopting the right predictive modeling techniques,
BIG W can craft effective strategies for sales growth, market presence, and overall relevance in the
evolving retail landscape.
